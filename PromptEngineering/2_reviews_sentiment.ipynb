Your feedback on the sound quality, noise cancellation, battery life, and comfort means the world to us. Thanks for the amazing review!\"], ['Smartphone', 'Extremely disappointed with this phone. It overheats within 10 minutes of gaming, and the battery drains rapidly. The camera is overhyped; photos are grainy in low light, and the autofocus is slow. For the price, there are far better options in the market. Avoid this model.', 'Negative', \"We're truly sorry to hear about your negative experience.  Overheating and poor battery life are unacceptable.  Could you please contact our support team so we can investigate and find a solution?\"], ['Air Purifier', 'The air purifier is decent but not extraordinary. It does a good job of clearing odors and dust, but the fan is quite noisy at higher speeds. The replacement filters are also expensive. Overall, itâ€™s functional but could use some improvements.', 'Neutral', \"We appreciate your feedback.  We're glad it effectively removes odors and dust. We acknowledge the noise level and filter cost concerns and are exploring ways to improve future models.\"], ['Electric Kettle', 'This kettle is a lifesaver for my busy mornings. It boils water in under two minutes, and the auto shut-off feature adds safety. The stainless steel body is durable, and the sleek design looks great in my kitchen.

Regret buying this.', 'Negative', 'We sincerely apologize for your negative experience.  Inaccurate readings and app issues are unacceptable. Please contact us directly with details so we can investigate and offer a solution.  We value your feedback.'], ['Gaming Chair', 'The chair is comfortable but not exceptional. It offers good lumbar support, but the armrests feel flimsy and canâ€™t be adjusted properly. For the price, I expected better build quality. Itâ€™s fine if youâ€™re on a budget but not great for hardcore gamers.', 'Neutral', \"Thanks for your feedback! We appreciate your comments on the comfort and lumbar support.  We'll look into improving the armrest sturdiness and adjustability for future designs.\"], ['Coffee Maker', 'This coffee maker is a game changer! It brews a perfect cup every time, and the programmable timer ensures I wake up to fresh coffee. Cleaning is easy, and the design fits well on my countertop. Worth every penny for coffee enthusiasts.', 'Positive', \"We're thrilled you love your new coffee maker!  Your feedback means so much to us.  We appreciate you sharing your positive experience. Enjoy those perfect cups!\"], ['Wireless Router', 'This router is terrible. The Wi-Fi signal is weak, even in the same room, and it drops connections constantly. Firmware updates donâ€™t help, and tech support is useless. Stay away from this model if you value a stable internet connection.', 'Negative', 'We sincerely apologize for your negative experience.  Weak signal and frequent disconnections are unacceptable.  Please contact us directly with your order details so we can investigate and find a solution.'], ['DSLR Camera', 'The camera delivers decent image quality, but it struggles with autofocus in low light.
